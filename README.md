# Weather-prediction
Building an LSTM model for Weather prediction

# Description:
This repository demonstrates the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict weather conditions based on historical data. LSTMs are well-suited for time-series analysis, and this project aims to showcase their application in forecasting temperature, humidity, or other weather attributes.

# Features:
Time-Series Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for handling missing data, normalization, and creating sequences for LSTM input.
Model Implementation: Builds an LSTM model to predict weather variables such as temperature, humidity, or precipitation.
Evaluation: Analyzes the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Provides time-series plots comparing predicted and actual values to evaluate the model's accuracy.
